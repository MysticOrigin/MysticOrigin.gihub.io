        <p>A member of the group, Camille, decided to leave Epita at the beginning of February. 
          She does not participate in the majority of the project, but she contributed to the birth of this game, 
          that's why she is mentioned on this page, as well as the other members of the group.</p>
        <p>There was therefore a vacancy, and Paloma joined us in March.</p>

      <p>Fascinated by computers since elementary school, it was in high school that I decided to pursue
        computer engineering in college. I loved computers but had only a vague idea of how they 
        work ! After a year in PTSI preparatory school, I joined Epita via the parallel 
        admissions in search of more practical experience in computer science : what the practical works and 
        projects bring in a quantity that is more than satisfactory ! I have great expectations for this project 
        and I'm very enthusiastic to work on it.</p>
      <p>I've been playing video games since I was 6 years old, when my brother got a Wii with Mario Galaxy, 
        which remains my favorite game of all time. In the meantime, I've dropped this medium a bit but it's with the 
        lockdown of March 2020 that I got back into it : I missed it a lot !
        I discovered JRPGs, a genre that marked me by its approach of narration and 
        characters. Which makes me even happier to work on this particular project ! Moreover,
         I am adept of digital drawing on Procreate and Clip Studio Paint, which will be very useful 
         in a project that will require, among other things, the creation of images to stand out from the rest. I am
         happy to be able to use my drawing skills for a concrete purpose: the creation of the 
         the world of Mystic Origin!</p>

      <p>Having grown up with a computer scientist stepfather, I have always lived in an environment 
        where computers were present. That's why I chose the speciality 
        Digital and Computer Sciences (NSI) in high school. I then chose Epita to deepen my knowledge 
        acquired during these two years of high school as well as the one I was able to develop at home. 
        Computer science has always interested me because of its logic and its relationship with mathematics,
        which are also one of my favorite subjects. In today's world, computer science is becoming more and more 
        importance by the development of automation and video games. </p>
      <p>I started playing video games at the age of 8 with Mario Kart on Wii and Pok√©mon on DS.
        I have never left the incredible world of video games in which I have taken refuge many times to 
       to escape the stress of everyday life. That's why the creation of a video game 
       with my classmates immediately seemed very interesting to me, both for what I will learn in relation to
        the human aspect of developing in a group with other students, and the fact that I will be able to do it
        with my classmates, which will allow me to develop relationships as well as skills in game creation.</p>

    <p>Having discovered computer science only in high school with the NSI speciality and having never 
      coded outside of this framework, one can't really say that I fell into the 
      magic potion as a child. However, computer science attracts me by its various 
      possibilities and the logic behind it.</p>
      <p>Unlike most of my peers, I hardly play video games (oops). 
        I haven't really touched them since my Nintendo DS, in fact, so since the middle ages 
        in terms of video games. If I'll be less focused on the purely technical aspect
        of our project, I'm going to do my part when it comes to writing a script or imagining an 
        universe, writing and planning our written reports or simply motivating the group, 
        reminding us of deadlines and getting organized. This will be my first big project, so I have a lot of room for 
        improvement. This will allow me to learn even more, especially in fields I still know too little about.</p>

      <p>It is with great pleasure that I joined Epicala Studio. My friends have made me feel integrated from the very beginning. 
        I enjoy working with them and want to give my best !
         I arrived in this group during the year, I was lucky to find a 
         project that I like. Indeed, I am also a mythology fan ! Whether it is Greek, 
         Egyptian or Nordic, each one has this little something that makes me resonate. When I hear the words 
         Greek mythology, I think of the myth of Medusa, Percy Jackson and Phaedra.
         All these stories have animated my childhood, my adolescence. About the Egyptian mythology, 
         who has never admired this culture ? These gods, so charismatic and powerful, have aroused my 
         curiosity from a very young age. I loved watching documentaries on these myths. 
         Finally, for the Nordic mythology, how can we not talk about the Marvel Cinematic Universe ? I am
         a huge fan of the Marvel license, I think I've watched almost all the movies. One
         Marvel series has caught my attention recently, that of Loki : a god of Norse mythology. 
         A complex character that I have become attached to. All this to explain that this project
         couldn't be better for me! </p>
        <p>With good friends and a good project, we can only succeed ! Nevertheless, I am a 
          novice in the field of programming, I hope that this project will allow me to feel more 
          comfortable with it.</p>

         <p>I'm a mathematics enthusiast but a pure muggle of computer science and algorithms ! 
          I discovered algorithms at the beginning of the year. It was, I admit it, 
          a bit violent but I loved the challenge ! Maybe a little bit crazy to come to Epita 
          without even knowing how to write a line of code? (Maybe, that's debatable) I chose Epita because 
          since I was young, I have a thirst for learning. And I understood that computer science, this 
          world that never stops evolving, would allow me to learn an incalculable number of interesting things 
          throughout my life.</p>
           <p>Video games ? I occasionally play with my family on the Playstation but that's about it. 
             However, I can't wait to create one as a group ! And I can't wait to learn technical programming 
             skills. I have very little experience at the moment but I am reassured by the other 
             members of the group: I know that they will do their best to help me understand what to do during 
             my first tasks so that I can become autonomous in my work later on.  During the New Technologies 
             and Societies classes, my partner Abel Roinsard and I had a lot of fun on Unity ! 
            And I feel that this project will be exciting and instructive for all of us !</p>
