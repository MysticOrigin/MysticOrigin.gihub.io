      <h1>Group's history'</h1>   <!-- Title of the page -->
      <p>This adventure has been full of twists and turns for our group. 
        Follow our epic journey here !</p>

      <h2>EPICALA STUDIO</h2> <!--Three parts, one for each group change -->

      <p>The team was created effortlessly although we are in different groups.  
        We chose the name Epicala Studio, "cala" being the initials of our first names. 
        What we have in common is that we like to acquire new knowledge and to be invested. 
        This project will allow us to learn many things and have fun ! </p>

      <p>Our group is mixed : our personalities and skills complement each other. 
        Indeed, some of us are novices in programming while others are more experienced. 
        Diversity is essential in a group because having different points of view and sharing them 
        allows us to improve individually and collectively. In a word : our different points of view 
        and experiences will lead us to improve our project and to progress together !</p>
      
      <p>Creativity, organization, motivation and mutual help will be the pillars of our team. <br>
        To organize our work, we have created a Discord server as well as a Trello board and we meet 
        regularly to work together, either at school or remotely.</p>

      <h2>EPIALA STUDIO ?</h2>

      <p>We used this quote in our specifications : "Coming together is a beginning, 
        staying together is progress, working together is success." (Henry Ford). 
        So, we succeeded in two out of three goals. I guess you could say that's something.</p>

      <p>In early February, one of our group members, Camille, left Epita. 
        As she was responsible for the website and the menus and options, we have redistributed her tasks : 
        Abel takes the responsibility of the menus and options because he was already auxiliary in this field,
        and Laurane is in charge of the website.</p>  

      <h2>EPIPALA STUDIO</h2>

      <p>We didn't think we'd have to rewrite a part about changing the group. 
        Fortunately, this time it is 
        for the better! As Camille decided to leave Epita, a place in our group was 
        vacant. So we are pleased to welcome Paloma among us. 
        We welcome her and hope she will enjoy her time with our group ! </p>

      <p>This change has raised a few questions. First, the name of the group is Epicala Studio, 
        with the suffix "cala" formed by the initials of the first names of the original group members. After 
        Camille's departure, we thought of renaming ourselves Epiala Studio (without the C of Camille). 
        Now, with Paloma, it would be Epipala Studio, which has a certain charm but could eventually affect
        our reputation. So we will keep our original name!</p>

      <p>On a more serious note, we have dealt with this change by trying to integrate Paloma into our ongoing tasks, 
        while taking into account her preferences and talents. So she will share with Abel the heavy task of 
        character design, will be responsible for the game's soundtrack 
        and will help with the design of the game's maps.</p>  

      <p>To quote Henri Ford again : "Coming together is a beginning, staying together is progress, 
        working together is success" ; we can affirm that we are tending more and more towards success.</p>
